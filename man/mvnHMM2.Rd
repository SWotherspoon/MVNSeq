\description{
Fit multivariate Normal 2 State Hidden Markov models by EM.
}
\details{
These functions fit multivariate Normal 2 state hidden Markov
models to sequences of observations, where the transition
probabilities are governed by logistic regression. \code{mvnHMM2}
fits a hidden Markov model to a single sequence of
observations. \code{gmvnHMM2} and \code{grmvnHMM2} fit separate
Markov models to several groups (sequences) of
observations. \code{gmvnHMM2} fits a hidden Markov model to each
group so that each state has a different mean across groups, but a
common covariance. \code{grmvnHMM2} constrains the means of the
states to be Normally distributed across groups.
